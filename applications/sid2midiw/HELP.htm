<p>
Only the console version of SID2MIDI comes with more documentation.
Please consult that package for additional notes. Since quite some
of the features are experimental and/or suggested by users, it
doesn't make much sense to provide more documentation than a few
notes.
</p>

<h3>The main window</h3>

<img src="main.png" width="296" height="238"><br>
<p>
The main window also accepts sidtunes via drag'n'drop. The
scroll-bar in the middle is the sub-song selector. The field
labelled "Seconds" is the period SID2MIDI will process the sidtune
and collect data. If you want a longer period, you can configure it
via the "General options" dialog. You may need to disable the
songlengths database. The average sidtune is no longer than 4-5
minutes, so default of 300 seconds would be reasonable.
</p>

<h3>The MIDI options dialog</h3>

<p>
<b>1</b> - The higher the noise level the more 
noisy SID sounds (e.g. effects or percussions) get mapped
to MIDI channels. The more of these sounds, the less
usable the MIDI file sounds. Level 1 is likely to give more pleasing
results for the average sidtune. Try increasing the level
if you think some voices are missing.
</p>
<p>
<b>2</b> - 
Pitch to note conversion: Convert any sufficient change of a SID
voice's frequency into a new note instead of a pitch wheel
controller command. Depending on the pitch to note threshold,
convert any smaller changes of frequency into
pitch wheel controller commands as usual unless the pitch to
wheel option is disabled. By default, pitch to note conversion
is off. <b>Important note</b>: This option is required by Paul
Norman's and some of Fred Gray's
sidtunes, for instance. It can also be used as an alternative to
capture arpeggio. If you get too many notes on a voice which makes
heavy use of arpeggio, portamento, or strong vibrato, set a
low value to limit the number of individual notes
being created, e.g. '4' will create at most four notes.
</p>
<p>
<b>3</b> - Pitch to wheel conversion: This controls how many
pitch-wheel controller events are created for sustaining frequency
changes. By default, as many events as necessary are created in
order to convert effects like vibrato, arpeggio or portamento.
<b>Important note</b>: Some sids apply heavy Vibrato and/or Portamento
and trigger new notes with a large frequency offset. If that is the
case, disabling pitch to wheel conversion completely would cause
SID2MIDI to catch wrong notes due to lack of subsequent changes in
frequency.
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>4</b> - Tempo: Override the default tempo in beats per minute
if automatic tempo-detection is disabled.
</p>
<p>
Timebase: Override the used timebase in pulses per quarter note.
</p>
<p>Pitchbend sensitivity: Specify the range of your MIDI pitch-wheel
in number of semitones. The SID chip can do portamento over its
full-range of 8 octaves (96 semitones). <b>Important note</b>: 
If your MIDI hardware or
software can only do two or three octaves, SID2MIDI may not be
able to convert long-range portamento slides correctly.
</p>
<p>
Scale speed: Fine-tune the speed of the sidtune above or below
1.0 (normal).
</p>
<p>
Pitch to note threshold: When pitch to note conversion is enabled,
this value specifies in which range changes in pitch are allowed
without triggering pitch to note conversion. It defaults to 1
semitone. For instance, if you want heavy vibrato to be converted
into pitch-wheel controller events, but much longer portamento
slides converted into new notes, you can increase this value until
vibrato doesn't trigger pitch to note conversion anymore.
</p>
<p>
<b>5</b> - Check envelope: Optimize note lengths by means of envelope
emulation. Uses the ADSR volume envelope emulation to determine the
duration of each note. Not using this may result in sounds 
"hanging" eventually.
</p>
<p>
Auto-detect tempo: Disables the "Tempo" field and makes SID2MIDI
determine a suitable BPM value for the MIDI file.
</p>
<p>
Extra events: Write a SID voice's pulse-width and volume level
to unused controllers 110 and 111. Note that the Text Output
mode is better for analyzing what the sidtune does with the
SID chip.
</p>

<h3>The general options dialog</h3>

<img src="general_options.png" width="328" height="148"><br>
<p>
Use this options dialog to point SID2MIDI to where you keep the
songlengths database file (usually called Songlengths.txt).
The "Autosave" feature constructs an output file name for
the MIDI (or text) file based on where you told SID2MIDI
to save the last output file the last time.
</p>

<h3>The other options dialog</h3>

<img src="other_options.png" width="333" height="121"><br>
<p>
These are explained on the SIDPLAY Home Page in the documentation
section. With modern sidtune collections like the HVSC, it should
not be necessary to enable the PlaySID memory model. That's why this
feature is disabled. It is recommended that you don't enforce NTSC
song speed.
