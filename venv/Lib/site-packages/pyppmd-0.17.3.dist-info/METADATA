Introduction
------------

``pyppmd`` module provides classes and functions for compressing and decompressing text data,
using PPM(Prediction by partial matching) compression algorithm which has several variations of implementations.
PPMd is the implementation by Dmitry Shkarin.
PyPPMD use Igor Pavlov's range coder introduced in 7-zip.

The API is similar to Python's bz2/lzma/zlib module.

Some parts of th codes are derived from ``7-zip``, ``pyzstd`` and ``ppmd-cffi``.


Development status
------------------

A development status is considered as ``Beta``.

WARNING
-------

* There is several known issues for PPMd8 Decoder that sometimes break resulted output,
  wrong EOF status detection, and deadlock when setting some parameter combination.
