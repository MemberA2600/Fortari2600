In data compression, BCJ, short for Branch-Call-Jump, refers to a technique that improves the compression of
machine code of executable binaries by replacing relative branch addresses with absolute ones.
This allows a LZMA compressor to identify duplicate targets and archive higher compression rate.

BCJ is used in 7-zip compression utility as default filter for executable binaries.

pybcj is a python bindings with BCJ implementation by C language.
The C codes are derived from p7zip, portable 7-zip implementation.
pybcj support Intel/Amd x86/x86_64, Arm/Arm64, ArmThumb, Sparc, PPC, and IA64.


Development status
==================

A development status is considered as ``Alpha`` state.


Installation
============

As usual, you can install pybcj using python standard pip command.

.. code-block::

    pip install pybcj
