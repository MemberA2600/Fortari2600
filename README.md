<h3><u>I. Introduction</u></h3>
<p align="justify">The Atari 2600. This is the main reason I left my original life as a social worker and became a developer. It's so simple, yet hard to master. It's bulky, but you have full control and only your skills can define what you can do with it.</p>
<p align="justify">We all know that with all these retro consoles, you have to be familiar with the CPU's byte codes and also the registers where the other chips can find the data they work with it and back in their golden era, that was it.</p>
<p align="justify">The Atari 2600 was not different. For a long time, the only way to make you own games was via 6502 asm and DASM.</p>

<p align="justify">In 2007, Batari Basic came and changed this situations. Most of the fans had some experience with old 8bit computers, so they propably knew Basic as I was messing around with my Commodore 64 as a kid. Batari Basic was simple, I could handle many bankswithcing methods, had two kind of kernels to offer (one customizable one with two sprites and one really static with 1 + 5 sprites).</p>
<p align="justify">Batari Basic was really sequential, so the only way to change the flow of the code was via goto, you only had really simple if-then-else statements and it wasted the ROM since it couldn't manage the sprite and playfield data, just copied it over and over it you tried to use it twice. But it had a nice, simple playfield and sprite editor, also a really, I mean, really basic music editor.</p>
<p align="justify">So, what did bB offer?</p>
<ul>
<li>Many cartridge formats (up to the 64K EF with SARA support)</li>
<li>Some basic edit tools</li>
<li>A really "basic Basic"</li>
<li>One customizable 2 sprites kernel</li>
<li>One multisprite kernel</li>
<li>The option to include a mini kernel to place items under the game screen</li>
<li>A really "basic Basic"</li>
<li>A titlescreen editor (supporting only one screen)</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">The other option is the CDFJ bankswitching + Melody cartridge. This hold a different philosophy, from professionals for professionals.</p>
<p align="justify">CDFJ is ARM based, (to be continued)</p>
